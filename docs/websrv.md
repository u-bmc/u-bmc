# Web Server Service

The web server service (websrv) provides the primary external interface for u-bmc through HTTPS endpoints that serve both ConnectRPC and REST APIs. It acts as the gateway between external clients and the internal u-bmc service ecosystem, handling authentication, request routing, and protocol translation. The web server integrates deeply with the IPC layer to coordinate with backend services while providing a secure, standards-compliant interface for management tools, web interfaces, and automation systems.

## Overview

The websrv service implements a modern, high-performance web server optimized for BMC workloads and constraints. Rather than relying on external web servers or reverse proxies, u-bmc includes its own purpose-built HTTP server that understands BMC-specific requirements like hardware resource constraints, security considerations, and integration with internal service architectures.

The server provides dual protocol support with ConnectRPC serving as the primary API protocol for modern clients and REST endpoints automatically transcoded from protobuf annotations for compatibility with existing tools and scripts. This dual approach enables both high-performance native clients and broad compatibility with standard HTTP tooling.

Security is built into every aspect of the web server design, with mandatory TLS encryption, comprehensive authentication and authorization integration, and careful attention to common web security vulnerabilities. The server operates within the broader u-bmc security framework while providing the necessary external access points for system management.

## Architecture

The websrv service implements a layered architecture that separates protocol handling, request processing, and backend integration. This separation enables clean implementation of different protocol requirements while maintaining consistent security and monitoring across all access paths.

### HTTP Server Foundation

The foundation layer implements a high-performance HTTP server optimized for BMC hardware constraints and workloads. The server supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and optionally HTTP/3 with QUIC for modern clients requiring enhanced performance. TLS 1.3 is mandatory for all connections, with configurable cipher suites and certificate management supporting both development and production scenarios.

Connection management includes appropriate timeouts, rate limiting, and resource management to prevent resource exhaustion on constrained BMC hardware. The server integrates with system monitoring to provide visibility into connection patterns and resource usage.

### ConnectRPC Integration

ConnectRPC provides the primary API interface using efficient protobuf serialization and modern RPC semantics. The integration supports both binary protobuf and JSON serialization, enabling clients to choose the most appropriate format for their requirements. Streaming RPCs enable efficient handling of long-running operations and real-time data feeds.

The ConnectRPC layer integrates directly with internal service NATS endpoints, translating HTTP requests into appropriate IPC calls and handling response aggregation and formatting. This integration maintains the benefits of the internal service architecture while providing a clean external interface.

### REST Transcoding

REST endpoints are automatically generated from protobuf service definitions and their HTTP annotations, providing compatibility with standard HTTP tooling without requiring separate API implementations. The transcoding layer handles URL path parameter extraction, query parameter processing, and request/response body transformation between JSON and protobuf formats.

REST endpoint documentation is generated automatically from protobuf comments and annotations, ensuring consistency between the primary ConnectRPC interface and the compatibility REST interface.

### Request Processing Pipeline

All requests flow through a comprehensive processing pipeline that handles authentication, authorization, request validation, rate limiting, and logging. The pipeline is configurable to support different security requirements and operational needs while maintaining consistent behavior across all API endpoints.

Request processing integrates with distributed tracing to provide comprehensive visibility into request handling across the web server and backend services, enabling detailed performance analysis and troubleshooting capabilities.

## Protocol Support

The websrv service provides comprehensive protocol support designed to meet diverse client requirements while maintaining security and performance standards appropriate for BMC environments.

### ConnectRPC Protocol

ConnectRPC serves as the primary protocol for u-bmc API access, providing efficient RPC semantics with modern features like streaming, cancellation, and comprehensive error handling. The protocol supports both unary and streaming RPC patterns, enabling efficient implementation of both simple request-response operations and complex real-time data feeds.

Client libraries are available for major programming languages, providing idiomatic interfaces that handle connection management, authentication, and error handling automatically. The protocol design emphasizes type safety and clear error semantics to reduce client implementation complexity.

Streaming capabilities enable efficient handling of operations like sensor monitoring, event feeds, and long-running management operations without requiring polling or complex state management in clients.

### REST Compatibility

REST endpoints provide broad compatibility with existing HTTP tooling and scripts that expect traditional REST semantics. All REST endpoints are generated automatically from the same protobuf definitions used for ConnectRPC, ensuring consistent behavior and eliminating the maintenance burden of dual API implementations.

URL patterns follow REST conventions with resource hierarchies and HTTP method semantics that map naturally to the underlying service operations. Query parameters and request bodies are handled according to standard REST practices while maintaining compatibility with the protobuf type system.

Error responses follow standard HTTP status code conventions while providing detailed error information compatible with both human operators and automated tooling.

### Content Type Support

The web server supports multiple content types to accommodate different client requirements and use cases. Binary protobuf provides maximum efficiency for clients that support it, while JSON offers broad compatibility and human readability for debugging and manual operations. Content negotiation automatically selects appropriate formats based on client preferences and endpoint capabilities.

Form data and multipart uploads are supported for operations that require file transfers or complex data structures that are more naturally expressed in form formats than JSON or protobuf.

## Security Implementation

Security permeates every aspect of the websrv design and implementation, reflecting the critical importance of BMC security and the exposure inherent in providing external network access to system management capabilities.

### Transport Security

All communications require TLS encryption using modern cipher suites and protocol versions. The server supports TLS 1.3 exclusively by default, with TLS 1.2 available as a compatibility option for environments that require it. Certificate management supports both self-signed certificates for development and testing scenarios and integration with certificate authorities for production deployments.

HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) is enabled by default to prevent downgrade attacks, and the server includes comprehensive security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, clickjacking, and content type confusion.

### Authentication Integration

Authentication integrates with the broader u-bmc user management system to provide consistent identity verification across all access methods. The web server supports multiple authentication mechanisms including session-based authentication for web interfaces, token-based authentication for API clients, and certificate-based authentication for high-security scenarios.

Authentication state is managed consistently across requests and integrates with session management capabilities that provide appropriate security properties for different types of clients and use cases.

### Authorization Framework

Authorization decisions integrate with the u-bmc security manager service to provide fine-grained access control based on user roles, resource types, and operation contexts. The authorization system supports both simple role-based access control and more complex attribute-based policies that can consider factors like request source, time of day, and system state.

Authorization checks are performed consistently across all API endpoints and integrated into the request processing pipeline to ensure that security policies are enforced uniformly regardless of the protocol or endpoint used for access.

### Request Validation and Sanitization

Comprehensive input validation and sanitization protect against injection attacks and ensure that only valid requests are processed by backend services. Validation is based on protobuf schema definitions and includes both structural validation and semantic validation appropriate for each operation type.

Rate limiting and request size limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks while allowing legitimate usage patterns. The validation system integrates with monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to potential security threats.
