It manages GPIO-based LED controls, coordinates LED states with system operations, and provides visual feedback for system status, component identification, and operational activities. The LED manager integrates closely with state management and hardware services to ensure that LED indications accurately reflect current system conditions and operations.

## Overview

Visual indication through LEDs serves critical roles in BMC systems including providing immediate visual feedback about system health and operational status, enabling easy identification of specific components during maintenance and troubleshooting activities, and indicating power states and transitions for both automated systems and human operators. The ledmgr service centralizes these responsibilities while providing consistent LED behavior across different hardware platforms.

The service abstracts the complexity of different LED control mechanisms including direct GPIO control for simple on/off and blinking patterns, PWM control for brightness adjustment and complex pattern generation, and I2C-based LED controllers for advanced multi-color and programmable LED systems. This abstraction enables consistent LED management behavior while supporting the specific capabilities of different hardware platforms.

LED operations coordinate with system state changes to provide accurate visual indication of component status and transitions, hardware operations to indicate activity and completion status, and maintenance operations to support component identification and troubleshooting procedures. The service implements intelligent LED management policies that balance informational requirements with power consumption and visual clarity considerations.

## Architecture
